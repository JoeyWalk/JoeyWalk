**JoeyWalk/JoeyWalk** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with GETTING AN INTERNSHIP PLEASE IM BEGGING
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the weather
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: a long quest that you must gain by questioning the Goblin Gary at the inn (my email works too)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been fencing for the last three years
